- type: NEW_FEATURE
  description: >
    The `resolve-deps` script will merge your plugin dependencies with the gloo dependencies and verify if it's compatible with the targeted GlooE version.
    If there are mismatched dependencies, use the information of outputted mismatched content to update your `go.mod` file.
    This means replacing existing entries and adding missing entries.
    Once you have updated the `go.mod` file, run the `resolve-deps` target again. You might need to do this a few times
    before all the dependencies match.
    The `go.mod` in this repo is know to work from GlooE `1.3.1` and higher
